## Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its simple syntax and readability make it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Getting Started

### Installing Python

To start using Python, you need to install it on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Writing Your First Python Script

You can write Python code using any text editor, but using an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can enhance your productivity.


## Basic Syntax and Data Types
Variables
Variables in Python are created by assigning a value to a name. Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to specify the type of the variable.
E.g. name = "Alice"
     age = 30

## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:

Integers: x = 10
Floating-point numbers: y = 3.14
Strings: message = "Hello"
Lists: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Dictionaries: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

## Control Flow
# Conditional Statements
Use if, elif, and else to make decisions in your code:

python code:
age = 20
if age < 18:
    print("Minor")
elif age < 65:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Senior")

## Loops
Python supports for and while loops for iteration:
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

## Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code defined using the def keyword:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))

## Modules and Packages
Importing Modules
Python has a rich set of standard libraries. You can import and use them in your code:
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))

## File Handling
Reading Files
You can read files using the open() function:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

## Error Handling
Python uses try, except, else, and finally for error handling:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("Division successful!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")

## Object-Oriented Programming
Python supports object-oriented programming with classes and objects:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())
